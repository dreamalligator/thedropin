These are the bare minimum yet possibly over-explained steps for creating a Pelican plugin.

*****
Steps
*****

Please let us know in an `issue <https://github.com/nebulousdog/thedropin/issues>`_ if we forgot anything!

Copy Plugin Base
================

1. Fork `thedropin <https://github.com/nebulousdog/thedropin>`_.
2. Change all dir names and references to this project's name[1]_.

.. [1] Python project names are typically short and lower-cased. If you make a single-word project, congrats, you never have to worry about inconsistent casing between projects. If you absolutely must use spacing, use underscores for project names, directories, and filenames.

Dependencies
============

See instructions for installing `Pipenv <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation>`_. Then run ``pipenv install --dev``.

Developing Your Plugin
======================

This is now where you get to get ðŸŽ¨ creative! Good luck, have fun.

ETC
^^^

This is wading into dangerous territory to start recommending text-editor practices, but if you open your editor from inside the Pipenv shell, that may help your editor loading the proper environment-specific dependencies.

Tests
=====

1. ``pipenv run tests``

Linting
=======

1. ``pipenv run lints``

Sharing
=======

Two great ways to share your code with the community.

Pelican Plugins Community Repo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Contributing a plugin <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/blob/master/Contributing.rst>`_ and `Using Git and Github <https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/contribute.html#using-git-and-github>`_ about adding a plugin to the ``pelican-plugins`` `repo <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins>`_.

Publishing to PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is probably the hardest part, and is why I'd wager there are so few Pelican projects registered on PyPI[2]_. Begin with the manual steps. Afterwards, add support for the automated steps as soon as possible while everything is fresh in your head.

.. [2] This is based on the following three `classifier <https://pypi.org/classifiers/>`_ searches. At the time of writing these are the tallies, with possible overlap between them; `Framework :: Pelican <https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Pelican>`_ (20 projects) + `Framework :: Pelican :: Plugins <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Pelican+%3A%3A+Plugins>`_ (12 projects) + `Framework :: Pelican :: Themes <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Pelican+%3A%3A+Themes>`_ (5 projects) = 37.

First Time
""""""""""

Your first time uploading a project to PyPI requires using `Twine <https://github.com/pypa/twine>`_. All of the below commands can be found in the `Pipfile <https://github.com/nebulousdog/thedropin/blob/master/Pipfile>`_ ``[scripts]`` section for your convenience.

1. ``pipenv shell`` Enter your dev environment where ``twine`` will be accessible.
2. ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`` Create a normal distribution.
3. `Register <https://pypi.org/account/register/>`_ on PyPI.
4. Think hard on your project name once more before uploading. Short lowercase 1 word names are best.

Optionally, you can do some checks on your distribution before attempting an official upload.

5. Also `register <https://pypi.org/account/register/>`_ on TestPyPI if you intend to test your distribution before making it official.
6. ``twine check dist/*`` Check the distribution you made in the second step.
7. ``twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`` Run a test of the upload. Preview at https://test.pypi.org/project/thedropin.

Back to the official upload steps..

8. ``twine upload dist/*`` Upload your project to PyPI.

Continue below before you're tired!

Automated Release to PyPI
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Visit https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/ to get your API token.
2. Create a project-scoped token.
3. ``gem install travis`` Install the Travis CLI.
4. ``travis login`` Log into the CLI app. Use ``--com`` if you've opted into the https://travis-ci.com/ beta.
5. ``travis encrypt -a deploy.password "your-api-token" --com`` Override the token in this repo. Travis is migrating to Travis travis-ci.com.
6. ``python ./release.py`` Save your changes and bump the version.

Try bumping the version and tags again using the release script. After you've found your groove with this, give yourself a pat on the back. Job well done!

************
Installation
************

1. ``pipenv install --dev thedropin``
2. update your ``pelicanconf.py``'s plugins settings to include the following.

   .. code-block:: python

      import thedropin
      PLUGINS = [thedropin]
